Hourly pets twitter is a Twitter bot, coded in python that posts a picture of a furry friend every hour! Simple as that! Images are grabbed from the [Dog](https://dog.ceo) & [Cat](https://thecatapi.com) API.

This program uses [tweepy](https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy), asyncio and various other libs to make this project possible!

## Installation & Usage

**It is recommended to create a virtual environment, learn more [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)**

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the necessary packages for this project.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Create a new file named creds.yml, and in the format of.

```yaml
API-KEY: 
API-KEY-SECRET: 
BEARER-TOKEN: 

ACESS-TOKEN: 
ACESS-TOKEN-SECRET: 

OTHER-API-TOKEN: 
```


Your API-KEY, ``API-KEY-SECRET``, ``BEARER-TOKEN``, ``ACESS-TOKEN``, ``ACESS-TOKEN-SECRET`` are randomy generated by twitter's API. Just simply input them into there. **This is essential to the bot running.**

the ``OTHER-API-TOKEN`` Is for the Cat API, as it requires an API key if you want to grab more images from the cat API, the dog api is 100% free. So no API key is required for it.

Once complete, run the command

```bash
py main.py
```
And enjoy! I wont provide on how to setup for docker & how to put it in a production environment.
